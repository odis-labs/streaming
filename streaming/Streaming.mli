(** {1:sources Sources}

    Sources are decoupled producer of values.

    Elements are pulled from a source when needed. A source can have an internal
    state that will be lazily initialized when (and if) a consumer requests
    elements. The internal state will be safely disposed when the source runs
    out of elements, when the consumer terminates, or if an exception is raised
    at any point in the streaming pipeline.

    Sources are a great way to define decoupled producers that can be consumed
    with {!val:Stream.from}. To learn more about how to create sources see
    {{:Source/index.html#creating-a-source} "Creating a source"}.

    The following example creates a source that counts down to zero:

    {[
      let countdown n =
        let init () = n in
        let pull i =
          if i = 0 then None
          else Some (i, i - 1) in
        Source.make ~init ~pull ()
    ]}

    It can be consumed with:

    {[
    # Stream.(from (countdown 3) |> into Sink.sum)
    - : int = 6
    ]} *)

  (** {1 Creating a source}

    Implementing your own custom sources enables access to many useful
    operations. The most flexible way to create a source is with the
    {!val:Source.make} function.

    The following example creates a source that counts down to zero:

    {[
      let countdown n =
        let init () = n in

(** {1:sinks Sinks}

  Sinks are decoupled consumer of values.

  Sinks are streaming abstractions that consume values and produce an
  aggregated value as a result. The result value is extracted from an internal
  state that is built incrementally. The internal state can acquire resources
  that are guaranteed to be terminated when the sink is filled.

  Sinks are a great way to define decoupled consumers that can be filled with
  {!val:Stream.into}. To learn more about how to create sinks see
  {{:Sink/index.html#creating-a-sink} "Creating a sink"}.

  The following example demonstrates a sink that consumes all elements into a list:

  {[
    let list_sink =
      let init () = [] in
      let push acc x = x :: acc in
      let stop acc = List.rev acc in
      Sink.make ~init ~push ~stop ()
  ]}

  It can be used with:

  {[
    # Stream.(iota 5 |> into list_sink)
    - : int list = [0; 1; 2; 3; 4]
  ]} *)

(** Type for sinks that consume elements of type ['a] and, once done, produce
    a value of type ['b]. *)
type ('a, 'b) sink


(** Module with defintions for sinks.

    Sinks are streaming abstractions that consume values and produce an
    aggregated value as a result. The result value is extracted from an internal

    that are guaranteed to be terminated when the sink is filled.

    Sinks are a great way to define decoupled consumers that can be filled with
    {!val:Stream.into}.

    Sinks are independent from sources and streams. You can think of them as
    packed arguments for folding functions with early termination. Formally,
    they can also be interpreted as

      If [sink] consumes integers, but we have an input with strings, we can

  (** {1 Syntax definitions}

      In addition to using the sinks and operations defined above, it is
      possible to create sinks with a convenient [(let)] notation.

      A common example of a composed sink is the sink that computes the
      arithmetic mean:

      {[
      let mean =
        let open Sink.Syntax in
        let+ total = Sink.sum
        and+ count = Sink.len in
        total / count
      ]}

      The resulting sink has type [(int, int) sink] and will only consume the
      input once! *)

  (** Module with syntax definitions for sinks. *)
  module Syntax : sig
    val return : 'r -> ('a, 'r) t
    val (let*) : ('a, 'r1) t -> ('r1 -> ('a, 'r2) t) -> ('a, 'r2) t
    val (let+) : ('c, 'a) t -> ('a -> 'b) -> ('c, 'b) t
    val (and+) : ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'c) t -> ('a, 'b * 'c) t
  end

  (** {1 Interface implementations} *)

  (** Module that implements the "Functor" interface. *)
  module Functor : sig
    type ('input, 'a) t = ('input, 'a) sink

    val map : ('a -> 'b) -> ('input, 'a) t -> ('input, 'b) t
  end

  (** Module that implements the "Applicative" interface. *)
  module Applicative : sig
    type ('input, 'a) t = ('input, 'a) sink

    val pure : 'a -> ('b, 'a) t

    val ( <*> ) : ('a, 'b -> 'c) t -> ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'c) t
    (** [f <*> sink] is a function application for functions contained in a sink.

        This operator can be combined with {!val:(<@>)} to run multiple sinks at
        the same time:

        {[
        let mean = Sink.((/) <@> sum <*> len)
        ]}

        Which is equivalent to the following version without operators:

        {[
        let mean = Sink.(map (fun (total, count) -> total / count) (both sum len))
        ]} *)
  end
end



(** {1:flows Flows}

    Flows are decoupled transformers of values.

    Flows define streaming transformation, filtering or groupping operations
    that are fully disconnected from input and output. Their implementation
    intercepts an internal folding function and modifies the input one value at
    a time.

    Flows are a great way to define decoupled transformations that can be used
    with {!val:Stream.via}.

    A flow can be applied to a stream with {!val:Stream.via}:

    {[
    # Stream.range 10 100
      |> Stream.via (Flow.map (fun x -> x + 1))
      |> Stream.into Sink.sum
    - : int = 4995
    ]}

    Flows can also be composed to form a pipeline:

    {[
    # let flow = Flow.(map (fun x -> x + 1) >> filter (fun x -> x mod 2 = 0)) in
      Stream.range 10 100
      |> Stream.via flow
      |> Stream.into Sink.sum

(** {1:streams Streams}

    Streams combine sources, sinks and flows into a flexible streaming toolkit.

    Stream is a purely functional abstraction for incremental, push-based,
    sequential processing of elements. Streams can be easily and efficiently
    transformed and concatenated.

    Stream operations do not leak resources. This is guaranteed in the presence
    of early termination (when not all stream elements are consumed) or in case
    of exceptions in the streaming pipeline.

    Streams are built to be compatible with {{:#sources} sources}, {{:#sinks}
    sinks} and {{:#flows} flows}. To create a stream that produces all elements
    from a source use {!val:Stream.from}, to consume a stream with a sink use
    {!val:Stream.into} and to transform stream elements with a flow use
    {!val:Stream.via}. For more sophisticated pipelines that might have source
    leftovers, {!val:Stream.run} can be used.

    A simple echo program that loops over standard input and prints every line
    to standard output until Ctrl-D is hit:

    {[
      # Stream.stdin |> Stream.stdout;;
      hello<Enter>
      hello
      world<Enter>

      <Ctrl+d>
