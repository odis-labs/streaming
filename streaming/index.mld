{0 Streaming}

Streaming abstractions that combine, transform and reduce large amounts of
sequential data efficiently, in constant space and without leaking resources.

{1 Overview}

{e Streaming} uses composable stream producers (sources), consumers (sinks) and
transformers (flows). The central model that abstracts over them is a
{{!module:Streaming.Stream} [Stream]}.

The following features are provided:

- {b Constant memory usage}: large or infinite streams can be computed in constant
  and small space. Buffering of the input is possible when needed.
- {b Excellent performance}: all models were designed with performance at the
  core. See {{:https://github.com/rizo/streams-bench} benchmarks} for detailed
  comparison with other libraries.
- {b Resource safety}: resources in effectful streaming pipelines are allocated
  lazily and released as early as possible. Resources are guaranteed to
  be terminated even when streams rise exceptions.
- {b Flexibility and loose coupling}: push-based and pull-based models are
  implemented to allow efficient zipping, concatenation and implementation of
  decoupled sources, sinks and flows.
- {b Streaming notation}: build streams and sinks using a convenient
  comprehension and applicative notations (see examples {{:#using-stream-notation} below}).

{1 Examples}

{3 Read lines from [STDIN]}

{[

  |> Stream.filter ((<>) "")
  |> Stream.map (fun line -> "You wrote: " ^ line)
  |> Stream.each print_endline
]}

{3 Using stream notation}

{[
# let items =
    let open Stream.Syntax in
    let* n = Stream.range 1 3 in
    let* c = Stream.of_list ['x'; 'y'] in
    yield (n, c)

# Stream.to_list items
- : (int * char) list = [(1, 'x'); (1, 'y'); (2, 'x'); (2, 'y')])
]}

{3 Using sink notation}
Compute the arithmetic mean in a single iteration of the input.
{[
# let mean =
    let open Sink.Syntax in
    let+ total = Sink.sum
    and+ count = Sink.len in
    total / count

# Stream.(iota 20 |> into mean)
- : int = 9
]}


{1 Resource handling}

Input and output resources involved in stream processing will have the
following two properties:

- Resources are aquired lazily and only if neeeded. For example,
  {!val:Streaming.Stream.of_file} will only open the file for reading when the
  stream is being consumed. Similarly, a sink for a file will only open the
  file when elements are being written into it. Sinks are initialized before
  sources, when the computation begins.
- Stream operations do not leak resources. The clean up functions for sources
  and sinks are guaranteed to be called in the presence of early termination
  (when not all input is consumed) and in case of exceptions in the streaming
  pipeline.


The following examples demonstrate these two properties in practice.

{3 Examples}

{[
(* Create a source that must not be initialized. *)
# let bomb () =
    Source.make
      ~init:(fun () -> failwith "Boom!")
      ~pull:(fun () -> None)
      ()
val bomb : unit -> 'a source = <fun>

(* Feed it into a stream that terminates early. *)
# bomb ()
  |> Stream.from
  |> Stream.take 0
  |> Stream.to_list
- : 'a list = []
]}

And... nothing! As you can see our "bomb" was never detonated. This is because
in streams, sinks (in our case it's [to_list] combined with [take]) are
checked for "fullness" before sources are initialized.

In the next example let's look at how streams behave in the presence of exceptions.

{[
# let i'm_a_source_i_must_not_leak () =
    Source.make
      ~init:(fun () -> `Dangerous_input)
      ~pull:(fun st -> Some ("always blue", st))
      ~stop:(fun `Dangerous_input ->
          print_endline "Stopping input... Phew!")
      ()
val i'm_a_source_i_must_not_leak : unit -> string source = <fun>

# let i'm_a_sink_i_must_not_leak () =
    Sink.make
      ~init:`Dangerous_output
      ~push:(fun `Dangerous_output x -> `Dangerous_output)
      ~stop:(fun `Dangerous_output ->
          print_endline "Stopping output... That was close!")
      ()
val i'm_a_sink_i_must_not_leak : unit -> ('a, unit) sink = <fun>

# i'm_a_source_i_must_not_leak ()
  |> Stream.from
  |> Stream.map (fun x -> failwith "Boom!")
  |> Stream.into (i'm_a_sink_i_must_not_leak ())
Stopping input... Phew!
Stopping output... That was close!
Exception: Failure "Boom!".
]}

Our termination functions run just before the world exploded!


{3 Limitations}

The termination functions in streaming are always guaranteed to be called. What
is currently not well specified is the state they will be called with. It is
possible for a source, for example, to stream lines from multiple files, while
seamlessly opening and closing them as the input is read. In normal termination
conditions, streaming will correctly call all termination functions with
correct states.

The same is not true in situations when exceptions are raised. Currently, when
there is an exception, streaming will call the termination function on the
first instance of the state, even though it might have changed.

This is not a difficult problem to solve, but a correct implementation has a
high performance cost.

In the future, streaming might expose safer stream management functions to help
with these situations. For now, it is recommended that sources and sinks
implement their [stop] functions in a way that allows them to close all
allocated resources when given only the first state. This can be achieved by
aggregating the intermediate states or using refs to allow the initial state to
point to the latest sate.


{1 Questions }

{2 When should I use [streaming]?}

[streaming] is a general-purpose streaming library with abstractions meant to
be used as a drop-in replacement for concrete sequential data-structures such
as lists. It is always a good idea to use a streaming model if you need
sequential access to data. For very small collections that do not need to be
processed multiple times, using lists is adequate. In all other situations,
streams are significantly better in terms of performance and composition.

Streaming abstractions are an excellent choice for stateful producers and
consumers that require precise resource management. Consuming elements
from a file or a database handler with streams is significantly safer. All
models in [streaming] are lazy (they will only initialise resources when
needed) and support prompt termination (the resources will be terminated
immediately when they are no longer needed). This is guaranteed even when
streaming pipelines raise exceptions.

Finally, streaming encourages implementation of small decoupled sources, sinks
and flow that can be reused in a wide spectrum of situations.

{2 How fast are Streams compared to other streaming models?}

In short - fast ({{:https://github.com/rizo/streams-bench} see} for yourself).
The {!module:Streaming.Stream} module was designed to improve the most
efficient iteration model currently available for OCaml, which is the so called
"internal iterator" with the type [('a -> unit) -> unit]. This iterator is
related to the commonly available "iter" functions in the standard library.

Streams are a variant of internal iterators that add support for resource
safety, early termination and avoid the need for mutations and exceptions in
the combinators. In addition to that, they provide a similar performance
profile.


{2 What's the difference between Sources and Streams?}

Both sources and streams produce values. The main difference is flow control:
with sources, consumers of the elements are in charge of control; while with
streams, it's the producers who drive the computation. This means that sources
should be used for situations where the elements are requested on demand, while
streams are best suited for "reactive" inputs.

In general, streams offer better performance than sources for the most common
operations (including concatenation) and offer
{{:Streaming/Stream/index.html#adaptors} integration} with sinks and
flows. On the other hand, sources are easier to create, and support
{{:Streaming/Source/index.html#zipping-sources} zipping}.

It is recommended to use sources to define decoupled producers that can be
consumed with streams. Any source can become a stream, but the opposite is not
so easy.

{2 Why are all streaming types in this library abstract?}

Even though the core types in streaming are very simple, stable and have many
nice properties, it is possible that the types might change in the future to
support new functionality such as backpressure and concurrency. To avoid
breaking changes, and until the library reaches the 1.0 milestone, the types are
going to be abstract.

If you have a use-case that requires access to the internal type, please
{{:https://github.com/odis-labs/streaming/issues/new} open an issue}.

{1 Troubleshooting}

- {b Incorrect [Stream] module} - if you forget to open [Streaming] you might
  start using the [Stream] module from the standard library. This will result
  in [Unbound value] and type mismatch errors.
- {b My stream pipeline never terminates} - this indicates that one of your
  producers or transformers produces an infinite stream. Make sure that you are
  limiting the stream input with operations such as
  {!val:Streaming.Stream.take} or {!val:Streaming.Stream.drop}.
