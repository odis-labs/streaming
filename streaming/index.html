For example, <a href="Streaming/Stream/index.html#val-of_file"><code>Streaming.Stream.of_file</code></a> will only open the file for reading when the stream is being consumed. Similarly, a sink for a file will only open the file when elements are being written into it. Sinks are initialized before sources, when the computation begins.</li><li>Stream operations do not leak resources. The clean up functions for sources and sinks are guaranteed to be called in the presence of early termination (when not all input is consumed) and in case of exceptions in the streaming pipeline.</li></ul><p>The following examples demonstrate these two properties in practice.</p><h4 id="examples_2"><a href="#examples_2" class="anchor"></a>Examples</h4><pre><code>(* Create a source that must not be initialized. *)
# let bomb () =
    Source.make
      ~init:(fun () -&gt; failwith &quot;Boom!&quot;)

- : 'a list = []</code></pre><p>And... nothing! As you can see our &quot;bomb&quot; was never detonated. This is because in streams, sinks (in our case it's <code>to_list</code> combined with <code>take</code>) are checked for &quot;fullness&quot; before sources are initialized.</p><p>In the next example let's look at how streams behave in the presence of exceptions.</p><pre><code># let i'm_a_source_i_must_not_leak () =

Exception: Failure &quot;Boom!&quot;.</code></pre><p>Our termination functions run just before the world exploded!</p><h4 id="limitations"><a href="#limitations" class="anchor"></a>Limitations</h4><p>The termination functions in streaming are always guaranteed to be called. What is currently not well specified is the state they will be called with. It is possible for a source, for example, to stream lines from multiple files, while seamlessly opening and closing them as the input is read. In normal termination conditions, streaming will correctly call all termination functions with correct states.</p><p>The same is not true in situations when exceptions are raised. Currently, when there is an exception, streaming will call the termination function on the first instance of the state, even though it might have changed.</p><p>This is not a difficult problem to solve, but a correct implementation has a high performance cost.</p><p>In the future, streaming might expose safer stream management functions to help with these situations. For now, it is recommended that sources and sinks implement their <code>stop</code> functions in a way that allows them to close all allocated resources when given only the first state. This can be achieved by aggregating the intermediate states or using refs to allow the initial state to point to the latest sate.</p><h2 id="questions"><a href="#questions" class="anchor"></a>Questions</h2><h3 id="when-should-i-use-streaming?"><a href="#when-should-i-use-streaming?" class="anchor"></a>When should I use <code>streaming</code>?</h3><p><code>streaming</code> is a general-purpose streaming library with abstractions meant to be used as a drop-in replacement for concrete sequential data-structures such as lists. It is always a good idea to use a streaming model if you need sequential access to data. For very small collections that do not need to be processed multiple times, using lists is adequate. In all other situations, streams are significantly better in terms of performance and composition.</p><p>Streaming abstractions are an excellent choice for stateful producers and consumers that require precise resource management. Consuming elements from a file or a database handler with streams is significantly safer. All models in <code>streaming</code> are lazy (they will only initialise resources when needed) and support prompt termination (the resources will be terminated immediately when they are no longer needed). This is guaranteed even when streaming pipelines raise exceptions.</p><p>Finally, streaming encourages implementation of small decoupled sources, sinks and flow that can be reused in a wide spectrum of situations.</p><h3 id="how-fast-are-streams-compared-to-other-streaming-models?"><a href="#how-fast-are-streams-compared-to-other-streaming-models?" class="anchor"></a>How fast are Streams compared to other streaming models?</h3><p>In short - fast (<a href="https://github.com/rizo/streams-bench">see</a> for yourself). The <a href="Streaming/Stream/index.html"><code>Streaming.Stream</code></a> module was designed to improve the most efficient iteration model currently available for OCaml, which is the so called &quot;internal iterator&quot; with the type <code>('a -&gt; unit) -&gt; unit</code>. This iterator is related to the commonly available &quot;iter&quot; functions in the standard library.</p><p>Streams are a variant of internal iterators that add support for resource safety, early termination and avoid the need for mutations and exceptions in the combinators. In addition to that, they provide a similar performance profile.</p><h3 id="what's-the-difference-between-sources-and-streams?"><a href="#what's-the-difference-between-sources-and-streams?" class="anchor"></a>What's the difference between Sources and Streams?</h3><p>Both sources and streams produce values. The main difference is flow control: with sources, consumers of the elements are in charge of control; while with streams, it's the producers who drive the computation. This means that sources should be used for situations where the elements are requested on demand, while streams are best suited for &quot;reactive&quot; inputs.</p><p>In general, streams offer better performance than sources for the most common operations (including concatenation) and offer <a href="Streaming/Stream/index.html#adaptors">integration</a> with sinks and flows. On the other hand, sources are easier to create, and support <a href="Streaming/Source/index.html#zipping-sources">zipping</a>.</p><p>It is recommended to use sources to define decoupled producers that can be consumed with streams. Any source can become a stream, but the opposite is not so easy.</p><h3 id="why-are-all-streaming-types-in-this-library-abstract?"><a href="#why-are-all-streaming-types-in-this-library-abstract?" class="anchor"></a>Why are all streaming types in this library abstract?</h3><p>Even though the core types in streaming are very simple, stable and have many nice properties, it is possible that the types might change in the future to support new functionality such as backpressure and concurrency. To avoid breaking changes, and until the library reaches the 1.0 milestone, the types are going to be abstract.</p><p>If you have a use-case that requires access to the internal type, please <a href="https://github.com/odis-labs/streaming/issues/new">open an issue</a>.</p><h3 id="how-can-the-net-amount-of-entropy-of-the-universe-be-massively-decreased?"><a href="#how-can-the-net-amount-of-entropy-of-the-universe-be-massively-decreased?" class="anchor"></a>How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?</h3> <details style="cursor: pointer"><summary>You should ask AC.</summary> <pre><code>let answer () =
