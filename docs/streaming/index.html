It is always a good idea to use a streaming model if you need sequential access to data. For very small collections that do not need to be processed multiple times, using lists is adequate. In all other situations, streams are significantly better in terms of performance and composition.</p><p>Streaming abstractions are an excellent choice for stateful producers and consumers that require precise resource management. Consuming elements from a file or a database handler with streams is significantly safer. All models in <code>streaming</code> are lazy (they will only initialise resources when needed) and support prompt termination (the resources will be terminate immediately when they are no longer needed). This is guaranteed even when streaming pipelines raise exceptions.</p><h3 id="how-fast-are-streams-compared-to-other-streaming-models?"><a href="#how-fast-are-streams-compared-to-other-streaming-models?" class="anchor"></a>How fast are Streams compared to other streaming models?</h3><p>In short, very fast. The <a href="Streaming/Stream/index.html"><code>Streaming.Stream</code></a> module was designed to improve the most efficient iteration model currently available for OCaml, which is the so called &quot;internal iterator&quot; with the type <code>('a -&gt; unit) -&gt; unit</code>. This iterator is related to the commonly available &quot;iter&quot; functions in the standard library.</p><p>Streams are a variant of internal iterators that add support for resource safety, early termination and avoid the need for mutations and exceptions in the combinators. In addition to that, they are very faster in most situations. See <a href="https://github.com/rizo/streams-bench">benchmarks</a> for detailed comparison of different streaming models.</p><h3 id="what's-the-difference-between-sources-and-streams?"><a href="#what's-the-difference-between-sources-and-streams?" class="anchor"></a>What's the difference between Sources and Streams?</h3><p>Both sources and streams produce values. The main difference is flow control: with sources, consumers of the elements are in charge of control; while with streams, it's the producers who drives the iteration. This means that sources should be used for situations where the elements are requested on-demand, while streams are best suited for &quot;reactive&quot; inputs.</p><p>In general, streams offer better performance than sources for the most common operations (including concatenation) and offer <a href="Streaming/Stream/index.html#adaptors">integration</a> with sinks and flows. Sources are easier to create and support <a href="Streaming/Source/index.html#zipping-sources">zipping</a>.</p><p>It is recommmended to use sources to define decoupled producers that can be consumed with streams.</p><h3 id="why-are-all-streaming-types-in-this-library-abstract?"><a href="#why-are-all-streaming-types-in-this-library-abstract?" class="anchor"></a>Why are all streaming types in this library abstract?</h3><p>Even though the core types in streaming are very simple, stable and have many nice properties, it is possible that the types might change in the future to support new functionality such as backpressure and concurrency. To avoid breaking changes, and until the library reaches the 1.0 milestone, the types are going to be abstract.</p><p>If you have a use-case that requires access to the internal type, please <a href="https://github.com/odis-labs/streaming/issues/new">open an issue</a>.</p><h3 id="how-can-the-net-amount-of-entropy-of-the-universe-be-massively-decreased?"><a href="#how-can-the-net-amount-of-entropy-of-the-universe-be-massively-decreased?" class="anchor"></a>How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?</h3> <details style="cursor: pointer"><summary>AC: ...</summary> <pre><code class="ml">let answer () =
